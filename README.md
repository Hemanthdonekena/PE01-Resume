# Input
The input to the MyResume web app consists of hardcoded personal information including the Student Name , contact details, educational background, GPA scores, and details about their projects. This data is statically defined within the React components using JSX.
# Process
The React app takes the static input data and organizes it into different sections Student Name personal details, education, and projects. Each section is represented by a specific component such as Education, Projects, and ContactInfo. The React components render these details to the browser dynamically and the page is styled using an external CSS file Resume.css. 
The CSS ensures the page has a clean, structured layout with the appropriate font, background color, and margin adjustments.
# Output
The output is a visually formatted resume displayed in a browser. It showcases the Student Name,contact information,education background, and projects in an easy to read layout. The resume is styled and rendered in a way that makes it professional and visually appealing
